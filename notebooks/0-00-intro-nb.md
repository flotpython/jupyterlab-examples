# introduction

we're testing **jupyterlab**, together with rendering under **jupyter-book v2** (aka `mystmd`), and try to make sure both outputs are kinda consistent

:::{admonition} and the jb1 version on `readthedocs.io`
:class: dropdown warning

but ther's been a time where it was no longer an option with jb2  
plus, we've moved to `info-mines.paris` anyway...  

so for the record only

- last version on readthedocs.io was `jb1`

## purpose

what we do in this series of sample notebooks, is to summarize most of our common notebook recipes

````{admonition} for what targets
:class: seealso

and check how that renders in the following contexts

* jupyter book output, which is now our primary output medium
* jlab4, with a cocktail of extensions, at least
  * `jupytext`, `jupyterlab-myst`
````

## status

not always up to date, particularly in the areas where things no longer evolve much
