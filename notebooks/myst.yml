  title: flotpython - examples
  # I suspect the intention was maybe to use this for the title tooltip ?
  # in any case as of now 2024 june the title is used for the tooltip too (a bit silly)
  # and I can't see where this is used
  description: "dummy course to check for publication tooling"
  # this one causes additional buttons to be shown
  # in the upper right area (close to the github button)
